# lagging behind, a blog

This is a personal journal on my experiences as a software developer. Posts are
usually short and mostly focused on iOS development using Swift, but you may
also find abstract musings, records of failed hackings and the occasional rant
about life as a programmer. It's powered by
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) using the
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
