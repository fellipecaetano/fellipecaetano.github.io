Hi! üëã

I'm Fellipe Caetano and I'm a professional software developer hailing
from Brazil. I've been working with software development since 2010 and
specifically with iOS applications since 2011, being involved with several
projects written in Objective-C and Swift. I'm also a Computer Scientist
undergrad student at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

This is a personal journal on my experiences as a software developer. Posts are
usually short and mostly focused on iOS development using Swift, but you may
also find abstract musings, records of failed hackings and the occasional rant
about life as a programmer. You can also find me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) retweeting memes and
talking gibberish in Portuguese. ‚úåÔ∏è
